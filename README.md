# Flask Craft
A Flask web UI for managing a Minecraft server.

# Intention
Create a Flask web UI that connects to the Minecraft console via RCON and possibly (optinally) tmux. The web UI should show the console's standard output, allow the manual typing of arbitrary commands, but also offer web UI shortcuts to issue commands and interpret the output (e.g. /list to get online players then a player profile with shortcuts to manage that player like if you need to /kick them).

# Status
This project is very fresh and may never be useful.
